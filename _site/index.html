<p>The main objective of <em>capopt</em> is to speed up the automatic configuration of optimization algorithms. It implements several capping mechanisms for optimization scenarios. These methods use the performance of previously seen executions to determine a performance envelope, which is used to evaluate how good a new configuration is during its execution. If a poorly performing configuration is identified, <em>capopt</em> stops the execution and returns a penalized result value.</p>

<p>The following paper describes <em>capopt</em> in detail and present an extensive experimental evaluation. You can also check its <a href="suppcor">supplementary page</a> for further experimental details.</p>
