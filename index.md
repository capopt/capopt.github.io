The main objective of *capopt* is to speed up the automatic configuration of optimization algorithms. It implements several capping mechanisms for optimization scenarios. These methods use the performance of previously seen executions to determine a performance envelope, which is used to evaluate how good a new configuration is during its execution. If a poorly performing configuration is identified, *capopt* stops the execution and returns a penalized result value.

The following paper describes *capopt* in detail and present an extensive experimental evaluation. You can also check its [supplementary page](suppcor) for further experimental details.
