# capopt: Capping Mechanisms for the Automatic Configuration of Optimization Algorithms

Welcome to the capopt project website!

***

The main objective of *capopt* is to speed up the automatic configuration of optimization algorithms. It implements several capping mechanisms for optimization scenarios. These mechanisms use the performance of previously seen executions to determine a performance envelope, which is used to evaluate how good a new configuration is while executing. If a poorly performing configuration is identified, *capopt* stops the execution and returns a penalized result value.

**Keywords:** capping mechanisms, automatic configuration, offline tuning, metaheuristics.
