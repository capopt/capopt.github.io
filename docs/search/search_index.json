The main objective of capopt is to speed up the automatic configuration of optimization algorithms. It implements several capping methods for optimization scenarios. These methods use the performance of previously seen executions to determine a performance envelope, which is used to evaluate how good a new configuration is during its execution. If a poorly performing configuration is identified, capopt stops the execution and returns a penalized result value. The following article describes capopt in detail and present an extensive experimental evaluation. You can also check its supplementary page for further experimental details.
